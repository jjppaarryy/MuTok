    <h2>What is MuTok?</h2>
    <p>MuTok is a creator's studio for artists and producers. It helps you plan music-first TikTok posts, render them locally, and upload them to TikTok as drafts. Drafts appear in your private tab in TikTok, where you can edit and set them to public when ready. MuTok does not publish directly to your feed.</p>

    <h2>Who it’s for</h2>
    <p>Creators who want to batch-plan and render content on their computer, then finish and publish from the TikTok app. Currently in limited beta for creators.</p>
